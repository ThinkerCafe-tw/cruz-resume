# Implementation Plan

## Project Context
**Feature**: -original-description-clean-up-project-structure-i
**Description**: Feature to be implemented
**Design Phase**: Completed

## Instructions for AI Agent

Please analyze the requirements and design documents to create a comprehensive implementation plan. Consider:

1. **Requirements Review**: Understand all requirements that need to be implemented
2. **Design Analysis**: Review the technical design and architecture decisions
3. **Implementation Strategy**: Break down the work into logical, sequential tasks
4. **Dependencies**: Identify task dependencies and prerequisites
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Ensure each task maps to testable requirements
6. **Integration Points**: Consider how tasks integrate with existing codebase

## Task Generation Guidelines

Create tasks that:
- Are specific and actionable
- Map directly to requirements and design components
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Consider the existing codebase and architecture
- Are appropriately sized (not too large or too small)
- Include proper sequencing and dependencies
